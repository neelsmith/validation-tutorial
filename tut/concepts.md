The `midvalidator` relies on the CITE Architecture's model of documented scholarly editions.

The library introduces two key concepts related to the contents of these editions:  the *reader* and the *orthography*.


## `MidMarkupReader`

Classes implementing the `MidMarkupReader` trait are able to convert multivalent documents into one or more individual editions.

*Example*:  objects of the `MidProseABReader` class can read TEI XML with two levels of citation organized with TEI `div` and `ab` elements.  You create an `MidProseABReader` with a parameter identifying the type of edition you want to work with (an instance of a `MidEditionType`)


```tut
import edu.holycross.shot.mid.validator._
val reader = MidProseABReader(MidDiplomaticEdition)
```



`MidMarkupReader`s are required to identify *all* the types of editions they recognize.  For the version of `MidProseABReader` used in this tutorial, that is only the `MidDiplomaticEdition` type.


```tut
reader.editionTypes
```

The reader can create a new edition of a citable node

```tut
import edu.holycross.shot.cite._

val xml = "<div n=\"1\"><ab n=\"1\">Text 1<del>.1</del><add>.2</add> version</ab></div>"
val urn =CtsUrn("urn:cts:mid:unittests.1.xml:1.1")

reader.editedNode(xml, urn)

```

The `MidProseABReader` throws an exception when it encounters unrecognized markup.

```tut

val badXml = "<div n=\"1\"><ab n=\"1\"><watermark>Agamemnon</watermark></ab></div>"
val urn2 =CtsUrn("urn:cts:mid:unittests.2.xml:1.1")

try {
  reader.editedNode(badXml, urn2)
} catch {
  case e: Exception => println("Failed to create diplomatic edition: " + e.getMessage)
}
```

## `MidOrthography`

An `MidOrthography` defines not only what code points are permissible in edition, but also how they are composed to create tokens of particular types.  As the `MidMarkupReader` is required to identify what kinds of editions it can create, the `MidOrthography` is required to identify what kinds of tokens it can recognize.

Like the `MidMarkupReader`, the `MidOrthography` is defined as a Scala trait that can be implemented in other libraries.

The `latphone` library's `Latin23Alphabet` is an example.  It recognizes five types of tokens.

```tut
import edu.holycross.shot.latin._
Latin23Alphabet.tokenCategories
```


It implements the required function determining if a code point is allowed or not.

```

val a = 'a'.toInt
val alpha =  'Î±'.toInt

Latin23Alphabet.validCP(a)
Latin23Alphabet.validCP(alpha)

```

It also implements the required function tokenizing a `CitableNode` into a Vector of tokens.

```
import edu.holycross.shot.ohco2._

val n = CitableNode(CtsUrn("urn:cts:omar:stoa0179.stoa001.omar:2.8.4"), "creatus Sp. Lucretius consul,")

val tokens = Latin23Alphabet.tokenizeNode(n)
println(tokens.mkString("\n"))
```
