title: "About the midvalidator library"
---


This library supports fully automated validation and computer-assisted verification of scholarly editing projects.

While the library requires that your project follow the conventions of HC MID for organizing citable content, its central concepts -- reading a multivalent source to create multiple unambiguous editions, aligning content through URN citation at the level of the canonical citation scheme and the tokenization of the canonical scheme defined by the orthography of a diplomatic base text -- are abstracted in Scala traits that can be implemented in different libraries.
